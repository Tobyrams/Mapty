This is an application that I coded along during a JavaScript course with [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/). 
Mapty allows users to log thier workout being running or cycling. Mapty will store the users
information so that when they access the application later they will see their previous workouts.
